*NAME* : MOHAMED ASLAM.K

*INTERN ID* : CT04DR2272

*DOMAIN* :  FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION* : 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR* : NEELA SANTOSH

** MY EXPERIENCE OF TASK : Working on an API-based project gave me hands-on experience across the entire full-stack development process. I learned how to design, build, and integrate APIs while also developing both the frontend and backend components of a complete web application.

On the backend, I worked on:

Designing RESTful API endpoints

Handling CRUD operations

Implementing authentication and authorization

Managing databases and writing optimized queries

Ensuring secure and structured data flow between client and server

On the frontend, I gained experience in:

Fetching and displaying data using API calls

Managing UI state based on API responses

Creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces

Handling errors and loading states smoothly

I also learned the importance of:

Debugging API issues (CORS, JSON formatting, status codes)

Version control using Git

Testing endpoints using tools like Postman

Deploying the application and ensuring everything works in production

Overall, this project strengthened my skills in building end-to-end applications, improved my understanding of client-server architecture, and helped me gain confidence in developing real-world full stack solutions.
